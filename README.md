    Skyplatform - A mod for Minetest

Depends: default

Usage: Start a new world. Mapgen will be disabled (only air will generate),
and you'll start standing on a 100x100 m platform in the sky with high,
comftable walls around you that prevent you from falling down.

Dig the chests in the middle of each wall and then right-click them to expand
the platform.

The command
	/newskyplatform 1000
will create a new, additional skyplatform with its center at 0,1000,0 (height
of 1000). You can create diffrent skyplatforms at diffrent heights.

The command
	/spawn
will take you to 0,0,0 where a platform ought to be.


Additional machines for crafting the materials from default are planned
(cobble generator, ores, plants).
